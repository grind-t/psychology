Applied knowledge:
- A ﬁrm handshake conveys an outgoing, expressive personality
- A glance can communicate intimacy, while darting eyes may signal anxiety
- Gazing into each other's eyes increases attraction and affection
- Arms raised, chest expanded, and a slight smile are perceived as pride and high status
- We excel at detecting nonverbal threats: negative words (such as snake or bomb), angry faces, etc
- Experience can sensitize us to particular emotions, for example abused children are more likely to perceive anger
- Hard-to-control facial muscles can reveal emotions you may betrying to conceal:
  - Lifting just the inner part of your eyebrows reveals distress or worry
  - Eyebrows raised and pulled together signal fear
  - Raised cheeks and activated muscles under the eyes suggest a natural smile
  - A feigned smile is often frozen in place for several seconds, then suddenly switched off
  - A genuine happy smile tend to be briefer but to fade less abruptly
  - True smiles cause others to perceive us as trustworthy, authentic, and attractive
- The behavioral differences between liars and truthtellers are too minute for most people to detect (only 54% accuracy)
- Gestures, facial expressions, and vocal tones, which are absent in written communication, convey important information -> we may use voice meassge and emojis to help people better understand us
- Women have greater sensitivity than men to nonverbal cues (aka more emotional, more empathy)
- Facial expressions are universally understood
- We can use feedback effects to become more empathic: Let your own face mimic another person’sexpression. Acting as another acts helps us feel what another feels and make better emotional connection
